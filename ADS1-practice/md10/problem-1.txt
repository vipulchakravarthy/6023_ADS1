the problem is to calculate the factorial of 5 using recursion

fact(n) {
	if (n == 1 || n == 0) return 1;
	else n * fact(n - 1);
}
fact(5)
the answer will be 120
fact fucntion is called 5 times and the time complexiety will be O(N)
N is given input.
for 5
we get the recursion as
            5 * fact(4)
                     |
                     4 * fact(3)
                     			|
                     			3 * fact(2)
                     					|
                     				2 * fact(1)
            answer = 120
